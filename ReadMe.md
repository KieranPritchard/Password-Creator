# Password Generator

## Project Description

This project is a password generator, what it does is it creates strong and secure passwords for users.

The reason for this project was too practise with imported modules, for loops. It also links back towards what i want to base my career around, which is cyber security.

for this project i used python, because i done this project at the start of my learning journey with the language to practise of its various elements. 

i didn't really come across any problems with this project. This was because i was already aware of the 'random' module from my 'rock, paper, scissors' project, something which also helped was my youtube shorts and tik-tok feeds were all full of varients of this project.
